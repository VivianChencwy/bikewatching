## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **All features must be shown** - Lab 7 requires demonstrating ALL functionalities
2. **Keep it under 60 seconds** - Videos longer than 1 minute will be trimmed
3. **Speak clearly** - Even if you're nervous, speak at a moderate pace
4. **Practice once** - Do a test run before the final recording
5. **Check audio** - Make sure your microphone is working and audio is clear
